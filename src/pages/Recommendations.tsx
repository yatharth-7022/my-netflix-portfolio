            âœ¨ "It is with great pleasure that I write this reference for
            Yatharth, who worked for us as a software developer at Sarvh from
            June 2023. Unfortunately, due to a change in the companyâ€™s
            structure, we have made the difficult decision to make their
            position redundant. This in no way reflects on their performance,
            which was consistently excellent.
          </p>
          <p>
            During their time with us, Yatharth demonstrated strong technical
            expertise, a passion for problem-solving, a willingness to learn,
            and a collaborative spirit that greatly contributed to our teamâ€™s
            success. They played a pivotal role in developing and maintaining
            key features of our e-commerce website <strong>Sarvh</strong>,
            consistently delivering high-quality code while meeting project
            deadlines. Their ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and
            their proactive approach to finding innovative solutions set them
            apart."
          </p>
          <p>
            ðŸ’¼ "Yatharth also showed exceptional teamwork and communication
            skills, effectively collaborating with cross-functional teams,
            including product managers, designers, and QA. Their
            professionalism, positive attitude, and dedication to their work
            made them an asset to the team."
          </p>
          <p>
            ðŸŒŸ "I have no doubt that Yatharth will be a valuable addition to any
            organization, and I wholeheartedly recommend them for any future
            opportunities."
